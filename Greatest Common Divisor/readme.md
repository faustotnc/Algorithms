# Greatest Common Divisor âž—

As defined by Wikipedia:
> In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. For two integers `x`, `y`, the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is denoted `gcd(x, y)`. For example, the `gcd` of `8` and `12` is `4`, that is, `gcd(8, 12)=4`.

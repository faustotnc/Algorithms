# N-Queens Problem [üë∏üèΩ, üë∏üèº, üë∏üèæ, ..., üë∏üèª]
The N-Queens problem requires that `N` queens be placed on a `NxN` board so that no queen occupies the same row, column or diagonal as another queen. The N-Queens problem can be solved using the Hill-Climbing algorithm with random restarts.

## Solution: The Hill-Climbing Algorithm
We must first generate a random starting state which places a queen in a random row of each column. From there, we first check to see if the board is a goal state (no queens are in conflict). If not, we evaluate all of the possible neighbor states by moving each column‚Äôs queen through the rows of its column and generating a heuristic value for each of those states. When all of the neighbor states have been generated, we check to see if any states were generated that have a lower heuristic value than the current state. If a better state was not found, then we have reached the local minima and must perform a random restart. If a better (lower heuristic) state was found, then that state becomes the current state and the above process is repeated on that state.

## Keywords
- **Heuristics**: A *heuristic* is a measurement of how far away the current state is from the the goal state. In the case of the N-Queens problem, the goal state is to have 0 collisions, so the goal heuristic is 0. At any given state, the number of collisions represent the heuristic for that state.
- **Neighboring States**: A *neighboring state* is the state in which the board would be if a single move is performed. With the Hill-Climbing algorithm, we look at all possible neighboring states, and choose the state that will produce the lowest heuristic. At any give state, an `NxN` board will produce `N^2 - N` neighboring states.
- **Local Minima**: In the Hill-Climbing algorithm, a *local minima* is reached if the current state has a non-zero heuristic, and none of its neighboring states produce a lower heuristic. In other words, the algorithm cannot find a better solution than the current state.
